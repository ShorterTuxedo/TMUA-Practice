# TMUA-Practice 刷題機
A tool to help you practice for your TMUA, or any multiple-choice quiz. <br />
This tool was designed for the TMUA, but you can modify it to fit any multiple-choice exam, such as HKOI heat event. <br />
All you need is taking screenshots of questions, and fill in the correct answers. It'll handle the rest.

**UPDATE: UAT UK has updated their scoring system in 2024/25. It is now such that 6.5 in 2023/24 equates to 5.0 in 2024/25. Corresponding rough grade boundaries are below:**
